## COVID19Worldwide

This is react + redux + material ui project. I created this web app, so people around the world get updates about COVID19 quickly. This web app provides the latest statistics about COVID19. Statistics include the total cases, deaths, recovered, total cases per day, etc. This web app provides the COVID data about more than 200 countries around the world. This web app creates line, bar and pie charts about COVID19 data. Data with graphs is straightforward for the user to understand.

## Redux

The state of this app is managed by redux. All data is coming from open source APIs. All APIs call done with help of redux actions. Axios is used for networking. After AXIOS, all data passed to the redux store. Then different components of this web app get data from the redux store.
